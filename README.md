## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Set Up

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davithunanyan/dhunanyan-blog.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd dhunanyan-blog
```

3. **Set Node version to 20 using NVM**

```bash
# WARNING - this can be done manually by downloading the version from https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
nvm use `cat .nvmrc` # Windows
nvm use # MacOS / Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn install
```

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command starts the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## üõ† Building and Running for Production

1. **Generate Static Build**

```bash
yarn build
```

This command optimizes the app for production, including compiling and minifying files.

2. **Run the Production Build**

```bash
yarn start
```

Your Next.js app will start on http://localhost:3000 and be ready for high-performance production use.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. **Deploy to Netlify**

Create PR to **`netlify`** branch and merge it or in order to force:

```bash
  git branch -m netlify
  git push -f origin netlify
```

There are not Git workflows are other automation created for extra testing layer before production build (such as unit tests, jest coverage etc...). So each time anything is being merged to **`netlify`** it triggers a deployment job on [**Netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dhunanyan/deploys) side.
